Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file from the top level
folder and consider the following notes:

* Topbeat makes use of Cgo, so in addition to having Go installed you need a C
  compiler for your operating system.
* Topbeat aims to support multiple operating systems. Please think about adding
  new functionality in a way that makes sense for all supported operating
  systems, not only the one you are using.
