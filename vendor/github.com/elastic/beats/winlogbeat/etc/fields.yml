  fields:
    - name: beat.name
      description: >
        The name of the Beat sending the log messages. If the shipper name is
        set in the configuration file, then that value is used. If it is not
        set, the hostname is used.

    - name: beat.hostname
      description: >
        The hostname as returned by the operating system on which the Beat is
        running.

    - name: "@timestamp"

      format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.milliZ
      example: 2015-01-24T14:06:05.071Z
      description: >
        The timestamp when the event log record was generated.

    - name: type
      required: true
      description: >
        The event log API type used to read the record. The possible values are
        "wineventlog" for the Windows Event Log API or "eventlogging" for the
        Event Logging API.

        The Event Logging API was designed for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP,
        or Windows 2000 operating systems. In Windows Vista, the event logging
        infrastructure was redesigned. On Windows Vista or later operating
        systems, the Windows Event Log API is used. Winlogbeat automatically
        detects which API to use for reading event logs.

    - name: count
      type: int
      required: true
      description: >
        The number of event log records represented in the event. This field is
        always set to 1.

eventlog:
  type: group
  description: >
    Contains data from a Windows event log record.
  fields:
    - name: computer_name
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        The name of the computer that generated the record. When using Windows
        event forwarding, this name can differ from the `beat.hostname`.

    - name: category
      type: string
      required: false
      description: >
        The category for this event. The meaning of this value depends on the
        source of the event.

    - name: event_id
      type: long
      required: true
      description: >
        The event identifier. The value is specific to the source of the event.

    - name: log_name
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        The name of the event log from which this record was read. This value is one
        of the names from the `event_logs` collection in the configuration.

    - name: level
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        The level of the event. There are five levels of events that can be logged:
        Success, Information, Warning, Error, Audit Success, and Audit Failure.

    - name: message
      type: string
      required: false
      description: >
        The message from the event log record.

    - name: message_error
      type: string
      required: false
      description: >
        The error that occurred while reading and formatting the message from
        the log. This field is mutually exclusive with `message`.

    - name: message_inserts
      type: list
      required: false
      description: >
        The raw message data logged by an application. Normally this data is
        inserted into a parameterized string to create `message`, but in case of
        an error, Winlogbeat attempts to provide this raw data. This field is
        mutually exclusive with `message`.

    - name: record_number
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        The record number of the event log record. The first record written
        to an event log is record number 1, and other records are numbered
        sequentially. If the record number reaches the maximum value (2^32^
        for the Event Logging API and 2^64^ for the Windows Event Log API),
        the next record number will be 0.

    - name: source_name
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        The source of the event log record (the application or service that
        logged the record).

    - name: user.identifier
      type: string
      required: false
      example: S-1-5-21-3541430928-2051711210-1391384369-1001
      description: >
        The Windows security identifier (SID) of the account associated with
        this event.


        If Winlogbeat cannot resolve the SID to a name, then the `user.name`,
        `user.domain`, and `user.type` fields will be omitted from the event.
        If you discover Winlogbeat not resolving SIDs, review the log for
        clues as to what the problem may be.

    - name: user.name
      type: string
      required: false
      description: >
        The name of the account associated with this event.

    - name: user.domain
      type: string
      required: false
      description: >
        The domain that the account associated with this event is a member of.

    - name: user.type
      type: string
      required: false
